      <h5>React</h5>
      React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is
      maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and
      companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page
      applications. Single-page applications are apps that only need to load the
      JavaScript used in the project the first time that it appears onscreen.
      That means that if the JavaScript is revisited, it will appear instantly
      as it doesnâ€™t need to be loaded again.

      highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
      These features and more make coding with VsCode more efficient and more
      reliable.
